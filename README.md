TITLE: Solar System Animation Documentation
VIDEO DEMO: https://youtu.be/PkAjvFl0syA
DESCRIPTION: The Solar System Animation project stands as a captivating representation of celestial bodies, meticulously crafted using the dynamic duo of HTML and CSS.
This animated showcase portrays the sun, Earth, and its moon, dynamically illustrating their positions and orbital ballet in the vast expanse of space.
This documentation offers an extensive exploration of the project's architecture, design rationales, and comprehensive usage guidelines.

File Structure
1. index.html
The linchpin of the project, index.html, lays the groundwork for the webpage's core structure.
It orchestrates the layout and structure of the solar system animation, incorporating essential elements.
The HTML file serves as the canvas on which the responsive and visually captivating display of the sun, Earth, and moon unfolds.

2. style.css
The virtuoso behind the scenes, style.css, takes the stage in styling HTML elements.
Responsible for determining their appearance, colors, sizes, and animation effects, this stylesheet breathes life into the animation.
Each celestial body dons carefully chosen styles, contributing to the overall visual spectacle.

Design Choices
1. Visual Composition
The layout is a masterpiece of careful consideration, meticulously designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing and centered presentation.
Leveraging flexbox, the celestial bodies find their alignment and center on the screen, resulting in a visually balanced composition that captivates the viewer.

2. Animation Effects
The mesmerizing dance of the solar system owes its magic to CSS animations. The @keyframes rule takes center stage, defining the orbit effect.
This orchestration allows the Earth and moon to execute a graceful rotation, adding a layer of realism and engagement to the animation.

3. Styling Details
Delving into the color palette, intentional choices elevate the visual appeal of the celestial bodies.
The sun radiates with a bright yellow hue, accentuating its vibrant and powerful nature.
The Earth boasts a gradient background, seamlessly transitioning from serene blues to lush greens, symbolizing the planet's diverse landscapes.
The moon, adorned with a silver color, introduces an element of elegance to its appearance.

4. Code Organization
In a bid to enhance code organization and readability, CSS pseudo-elements (::before) step into the limelight.
Specifically applied to the Earth and moon, these elements introduce additional styling details.
This practice not only elevates the aesthetics but also contributes to the code's modularity and maintainability.
